# [TSE] FISE2 Project High Performance Computing

## Project Description:

The underlying scenario addresses the analysis metrics for a dynamic (evolving) social-network graph. Specifically, the 2016 Grand Challenge targets following problems: identification of the posts that currently trigger the most activity in the social network. The corresponding queries require continuous analysis of a dynamic graph under the consideration of multiple streams that reflect updates to the graph.
